# exploring-sakila-dvd-rental-database
With SQL queries I explore the Sakila DVD Rental database to present insights about the rental behaviour and patterns in movie watching across different customer groups.

**The following questions are solved:**

1. What is the distribution of the family categories* rentals? 
*The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

2. Which kind of rating has the longest average rental rates grouped by store?

3. What are the top 5 paying customers for each store?

4. Which was the month with the most rentals in 2005?
